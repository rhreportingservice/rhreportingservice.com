# R.H. Reporting Service — Single Page Starter

Files:

- `index.html` — Single-page website with contact info, services, and structured data for SEO.
- `styles.css` — Simple, dependency-free stylesheet for a clean responsive layout.

How to view locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser directly, or run a simple static server:

```bash
# From the project folder:
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/
```

Next steps:

- Replace the `Logo Placeholder` in `index.html` with your logo image (update CSS as needed).
- Send edits to the background text or services list and I'll update the page.
